# **App Name**: SoarScape

## Core Features:

- One-Tap Flight: Implement single-touch input for the bird to flap and fly.
- Procedural Pipes: Generate pipe obstacles with random heights and gaps.
- Real-Time Scoring: Display the current score as the bird successfully passes pipes.
- Game Over Screen: Show a game over screen with the final score and a restart option.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Yellow (#FFEB3B) to represent the bird, providing a vibrant focal point.
- Background color: Light blue (#BBDEFB) to simulate the sky, a desaturated variation of the bird's yellow to allow it to stand out. 
- Accent color: Green (#9CCC65) for the pipes. This analogous color contrasts slightly, fitting a pixel art retro aesthetic.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk' for a techy, slightly retro look
- Pixel-art style icons for game elements like score, restart, etc.
- Simple, full-screen layout with score displayed at the top.
- Basic flap animation for the bird, and smooth scrolling for the pipes.
